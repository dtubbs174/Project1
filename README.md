# Project1
A Python CLI (Command Line Inteface) application to showcase CRUD functionality between Python and MongoDB. Theme is based on a banking application without discriminating between what would be the user's authorization level of access. For e.g.; a customer, a teller, and a manager would have access to different levels of the system in reality but this application lets any user access every ability of the application. 

To Use:
- Start MongoDB server in it's own terminal window with: mongod.exe
- Start the program in it's own terminal window with: python cli.py
- Any .json files to be loaded must be in the same directory as the application.
